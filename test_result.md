        -comment: "Fixed two issues: 1) Added the @api_router.post('/simulation/set-language') decorator to register the set_language function as an API endpoint, and 2) Updated the ConversationRound model to include the language field. Comprehensive testing of all major language pairs (English → Spanish → English, English → German → English, English → French → English, English → Croatian → English, English → Japanese → English, English → Arabic → English) and cross-language pairs (Spanish → German, German → French, French → Croatian, Japanese → Arabic) confirmed that the translation system is now working correctly for all tested language pairs."
