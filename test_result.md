The 'Clear All' button successfully deletes all agents after confirmation. UI/UX improvements are implemented correctly, including hover animations on agent cards, delete button hover effects, and a tip message about using the delete button. The 'Add Agent' button correctly scrolls to the control panel. Error handling works as expected, with proper handling of cancellation in confirmation dialogs. The visual design is professional, with the agent profiles section prominently displayed and delete buttons clearly visible but not overwhelming."

The audio narration toggle works smoothly, allowing users to turn it ON/OFF. Cost information updates based on audio setting ($0.10/month for text only vs $3.34/month with voice). Warning messages appear for languages without voice support. Selected language is properly highlighted. After selecting configuration and clicking 'Start Simulation', the simulation starts with the selected settings. Settings are saved to localStorage and persist across page reloads. The modal can be canceled, and transitions are smooth. All test scenarios passed successfully."
