The endpoint responds extremely quickly with an average response time of 0.051 seconds across multiple requests, which is excellent. The response includes all necessary document metadata and content, with a preview field for efficient rendering in the UI. The data structure is consistent and includes all required fields (id, metadata, content, preview). The metadata contains all required fields (id, title, category, description, created_at, updated_at). The preview field is properly implemented for large documents, providing a truncated version of the content for efficient rendering. Document counts are consistent across requests. Overall, the document loading performance is excellent and the data structure is well-designed for efficient rendering in the UI."

The endpoint correctly handles non-existent document IDs, returning a 404 Not Found error with the message 'Some documents not found or don't belong to user'.

The endpoint is expected to accept a list of document IDs in the request body and delete all documents that belong to the authenticated user.

The endpoint should return a 200 OK response with a message of 'Successfully deleted 0 documents' and a deleted_count of 0 when an empty array is provided.

        -comment: "Conducted extensive testing and debugging of the document bulk delete endpoint. The issue appears to be with how FastAPI is handling the request body for DELETE endpoints. Attempted multiple fixes: 1) Added explicit error handling in the endpoint, 2) Created a Pydantic model (DocumentIdsRequest) for the request body, 3) Created a test endpoint that doesn't require a request body, 4) Tried different request formats. None of these approaches resolved the issue. The endpoint continues to return a 404 error with 'Document not found' when an empty array is provided. This is likely due to how FastAPI routes and validates DELETE requests with request bodies. The conversation bulk delete endpoint was updated to use the same Pydantic model approach but still works correctly with empty arrays, suggesting there might be another issue specific to the document endpoint."

Created a new endpoint that uses a Pydantic model for the request body, a new endpoint that uses query parameters instead of a request body, and a new endpoint that just returns a success message for empty arrays. All of these approaches still resulted in a 404 error with 'Document not found' when an empty array is provided. The issue appears to be with how FastAPI is handling DELETE requests with request bodies for this specific endpoint. The conversation bulk delete endpoint works correctly with empty arrays, suggesting there might be some middleware or routing issue specific to the document endpoint.

The DELETE /api/documents/bulk endpoint consistently returns a 404 error with 'Document not found' message for both empty arrays and valid document IDs. The POST /api/documents/bulk-delete endpoint returns a 422 error with 'Input should be a valid list' message, indicating a validation issue with the request body. Tried various request formats including query parameters and different JSON structures, but none were successful. The issue appears to be with how FastAPI is handling the request body for these endpoints. This is a critical issue that prevents users from deleting multiple documents at once, which is an important feature for managing the File Center."

Created 37 test documents and attempted to delete them using both endpoints. The POST /api/documents/bulk-delete endpoint successfully deleted all 37 documents in a single request, returning a 200 OK response with the correct deleted_count. However, the DELETE /api/documents/bulk endpoint consistently failed with a 404 error regardless of the request format used (direct array, object with document_ids field, or object with data field). The issue appears to be with how FastAPI handles request bodies for DELETE methods. The POST endpoint is fully functional and provides a reliable alternative for bulk deletion operations. Authentication is properly enforced for both endpoints, and they correctly handle invalid document IDs. The user should use the POST endpoint for bulk deletion operations."
