The endpoint responds extremely quickly with an average response time of 0.051 seconds across multiple requests, which is excellent. The response includes all necessary document metadata and content, with a preview field for efficient rendering in the UI. The data structure is consistent and includes all required fields (id, metadata, content, preview). The metadata contains all required fields (id, title, category, description, created_at, updated_at). The preview field is properly implemented for large documents, providing a truncated version of the content for efficient rendering. Document counts are consistent across requests. Overall, the document loading performance is excellent and the data structure is well-designed for efficient rendering in the UI."

None of these approaches resolved the issue. The endpoint continues to return a 404 error with 'Document not found' when an empty array is provided. This is likely due to how FastAPI routes and validates DELETE requests with request bodies.
