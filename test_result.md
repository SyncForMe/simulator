Success messages correctly indicate whether a preview image was used ('Preview image used as avatar') or if an avatar was generated from the prompt without preview ('Avatar generated from prompt'). Edge cases were also tested: when previewing an avatar, then changing the prompt without re-previewing, the system correctly uses the previewed image; and when canceling agent creation after preview, the preview is properly cleared for new agents.
