        -comment: "Tested the POST /api/documents/bulk-delete endpoint. The endpoint is working correctly for all test cases: it handles empty arrays, valid document IDs, and non-existent document IDs as expected. The endpoint correctly returns a 200 OK response with a message of 'Successfully deleted X documents' and a deleted_count field. Authentication is properly enforced, with the endpoint returning a 403 Forbidden error for unauthenticated requests. The endpoint correctly handles non-existent document IDs, returning a 404 Not Found error with the message 'Some documents not found or don't belong to user'. This endpoint provides a functional alternative to the DELETE /api/documents/bulk endpoint, allowing users to delete multiple documents at once."
