Also tested agent creation with avatar generation, which works properly and stores the avatar URL and prompt in the agent model."

The Preview button correctly generates and displays avatar previews before agent creation. Created agents display their avatars in the agent cards with subtle animation effects (avatar-animation class and animate-shimmer). Error handling works correctly - the Preview button is disabled when the avatar prompt is empty. Cost information ($0.0008 per avatar) is displayed to users. All test scenarios passed successfully."
