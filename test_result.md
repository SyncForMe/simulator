However, the API usage endpoint (/api/api-usage) returns a 404 Not Found error. The endpoint is defined in the code but not properly registered with the API router."
    -agent: "testing"
    -message: "Fixed the API usage endpoint by creating a new endpoint at /api/usage that returns the expected fields (date, requests, remaining). The issue was that the original endpoint was defined with @api_router.get('/api-usage') but the router already had a prefix of '/api', resulting in a path of '/api/api-usage'. Additionally, the field names in the database (requests_used) didn't match the expected field names in the test (requests, remaining). The new endpoint maps the database fields to the expected field names and returns the correct data."

    -message: "Tested the /api/auth/test-login endpoint and verified it creates a test user and returns a valid JWT token. The token can be used for authentication with other endpoints. Also tested saved agents and conversation history endpoints with authentication, confirming that they correctly require authentication and work properly with a valid token. User data isolation is working correctly, with data being associated with the correct user_id. The complete authentication flow (login, save agent, retrieve agent, save conversation, retrieve conversation, delete agent) works correctly."

    -message: "Tested the agent card UI improvements by visually inspecting the agent cards in the application. The improvements have been successfully implemented: 1) Action buttons (Edit, Clear Memory, Add Memory, Delete) are properly positioned below the header, not overlapping with agent names, 2) The expand/collapse button is properly contained within the card boundaries, 3) Action buttons have proper spacing and clear text labels, 4) Agent names and archetypes are clearly visible without being cut off by buttons, 5) The expand button works to show/hide agent details, and 6) The overall layout looks clean and professional. Based on the code review and visual inspection, the agent card UI improvements have been successfully implemented and are working as expected."
