Success messages correctly indicate whether a preview image was used ('Preview image used as avatar') or if an avatar was generated from the prompt without preview ('Avatar generated from prompt'). Edge cases were also tested: when previewing an avatar, then changing the prompt without re-previewing, the system correctly uses the previewed image; and when canceling agent creation after preview, the preview is properly cleared for new agents. This fix ensures users get exactly the avatar they preview, eliminating the previous issue of random different images appearing."
