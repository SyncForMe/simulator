Comprehensive testing of all major language pairs (English → Spanish → English, English → German → English, English → French → English, English → Croatian → English, English → Japanese → English, English → Arabic → English) and cross-language pairs (Spanish → German, German → French, French → Croatian, Japanese → Arabic) confirmed that the translation system is now working correctly for all tested language pairs."

    -message: "Tested the translation functionality with various language pairs. Found and fixed two issues: 1) The set_language function was defined but not registered as an API endpoint, and 2) The ConversationRound model was missing the language field in the response. After fixing these issues, comprehensive testing confirmed that the translation system is now working correctly for all tested language pairs, including the previously reported issue with translating back to English."
