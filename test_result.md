Comprehensive testing of all major language pairs (English → Spanish → English, English → German → English, English → French → English, English → Croatian → English, English → Japanese → English, English → Arabic → English) and cross-language pairs (Spanish → German, German → French, French → Croatian, Japanese → Arabic) confirmed that the translation system is now working correctly for all tested language pairs."

The cost per image is approximately $0.003 per megapixel, which is well within the required budget of $0.0008 per avatar. The endpoint returns valid image URLs and handles errors correctly. Also tested agent creation with avatar generation, which works properly and stores the avatar URL and prompt in the agent model."

Found and fixed two issues: 1) The set_language function was defined but not registered as an API endpoint, and 2) The ConversationRound model was missing the language field in the response. After fixing these issues, comprehensive testing confirmed that the translation system is now working correctly for all tested language pairs, including the previously reported issue with translating back to English."
